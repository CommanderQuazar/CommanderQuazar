I am a low-level programmer based out of Seattle, Wa. I have a 
passion for low-level programming, operating system development, 
and computer networking. Iâ€™m fluent in C/C++, x86 assembly, and 
love learning about AI/ML systems. I believe that ambition and 
tenacity are the foundation of innovation.
