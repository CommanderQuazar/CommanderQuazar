### My name is Tobey AKA CommanderQuazar.
# CEO and Founder of Argon Galactic
LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/tobey-ragain-b252b41bb

I am a low-level programmer based out of Seattle, Wa. I'm fluent in C/C++, Python, SQL, and x86 Assembly.
I love computer networking and pen-testing as well!

### What I'm Currently Working On

Currently designing a complete home management system via Raspberry Pi. Subsystems include a security system,
light controllers, backup power for essential home functionality, and all tied into a sketchy virtual assistant named Carl. 

Since the school year was online I was able to code whenever, so I designed a program called ZOOMer that automates launching/closing
of virtual meetings (Teams, Zoom, Skye, etc). Available for Linux distros, MacOS, and Windows. There is a command line interface
version, and a GUI built with QT. Now you can just chill while your day flies by!

I am also working on a Raspberry Pi super clustor in my home lab.

### What I'm Currently Learning 

Operating systems are by far the coolest programs every developed by humans. I am learning about OS dev and history of these systems.
I love diving into the Linux Kernel to see how it ticks and hope to create my own kernel from scratch.
