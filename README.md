I love computer networking and pen-testing.

### What I'm Currently Working On

Currently designing a complete home management system via Raspberry Pi. Subsystems include a security system,
light controllers, backup power for essential home functionality, and all tied into make sketchy virtual assistant named Thrawn. 

Since the school year was online I was able to code whenever, so I designed a program called ZOOMer that automates launching/closing
of virtual meetings (Teams, Zoom, Skye, etc). Available for Linux distros, MacOS, and Windows. There is a command line interface
version, and a GUI built with QT. Now you can just chill while your day flies by!

I am also working on a Raspberry Pi super clustor.

### What I'm Currently Learning 

Operating systems are by far the coolest programs every developed by humans. I am learning about OS dev and history of these systems.
I love diving into the Linux Kernel to see how it ticks and hope to create my own kernel from scratch.
